Hi, I’m Lucia

@lucia-vargas-a 👋

I’m interested in Data projects, particularly data quality and data democratization. I also like to read, write and practice outdoor sports.

🌱 I’m currently learning about agile data requirements and solutions modelling and collaborating with Mozilla analytics projects!
